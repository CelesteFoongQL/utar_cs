                <h1>Skills to Answer Phone Call From the Industry</h1>
				<br>
				<div class="preplistdiv">
				<br>
				<ol>
					<li>Always pay attention on your phone after submit the resume because the phone may call from the company.</li><br>
					<li>Be in a quiet place with a good phone connection during the interview.</li><br>
					<li>Speak slowly.</li><br>
					<li>Sip water periodically - it will help you speak clearly.</li><br>
					<li>Avoid chewing gum, eating or smoking.</li><br>
					<li>Answer with your name. Answering by saying "this is (your name)" so the caller knows he's reached the right number and doesn't have to ask for you.</li><br>
					<li>Listen carefully the incoming phone and record the caller's name or name of in charge person.</li><br>
					<li>Focus on the conversation. Stop whatever you might be doing and take a brief moment to prepare.
					Wear the face you want to project before picking up the phone. It makes a difference: whether you're smiling, frowning, or bored to tears, your caller will hear that in your tone. 
					Smile - it makes your voice sound friendly</li><br>
					<li>When you answer the phone, be warm and enthusiastic. Your voice on the phone is sometimes the only impression of caller will get.</li><br>
					<li>Control your language when answering the phone. Don't use slang or buzzwords, such as 'cheers', 'uh-huh', 'mate', 'yeah' etc.</li><br>
					<li>Give short answers - talk long enough to answer the question but don't feel you need to fill every silence. An interview should be a dialogue rather than a monologue.</li><br>
					<li>Enunciate clearly, keep your voice volume moderate, and speak slowly and clearly when answering the phone, so your caller can understand you easily.</li><br>
					<li>Take phone messages completely and accurately. If there's something you don't listen clearly, ask the caller to repeat it for you. Then make sure gets the correct message.</li><br>
					<li>Acknowledge your understanding of the issue at hand, repeating back the main points if necessary.</li><br>
					<li>End the call with a positive statement.  For example, thank the person for contacting you.</li><br>
